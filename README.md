# XCVario Pure

An ESP32-based, lightweight variometer system with an open data interface supporting OpenVario, Cambridge, Borgelt, Naviter, and XCVario protocols, designed for dedicated XCVario hardware.

The project is rooted in the open-source and open-hardware flight computer community and is based on the ESP32 SoC, supporting modern digital sensors such as BMP280, SPL06-007, DS1820B, TE4525, ABPMRR, MP5004DP, AHRS MPU6050, and the QMC5883L magnetometer.

The variometer features a sunlight-readable 2.4-inch IPS LCD display with a brightness of 1000 nits and a low power consumption of less than 1.2 W, corresponding to approximately 100 mA at an operating voltage of 12.5 V. The device measures 64 (H) × 64 (W) × 35 (D) mm, fitting a standard 57 mm (2″) instrument gauge, and weighs approximately 170 grams.

## Vision
The widespread availability of high-fidelity sensors combined with today's highly integrated computing platforms provides an excellent foundation for a project like XCVario Pure. At the same time, it quickly becomes apparent that the overall quality of such a system is determined primarily by its software architecture. Developing a truly high-end variometer therefore requires a significant software investment. Continued improvements in quality, functionality, and usability cannot be achieved with a purely volunteer-driven "pick-it-for-free" approach. Sustained development requires both substantial engineering effort and a sustainable funding model.

The evolution from **XCVario** to **XCVario Pure** therefore comes with the addition of software expertise to the team. The open-source repository will retain all basic features, as it did initially. 
In addition, many features intended to create commercial value will remain closed-source and are therefore not part of this repository. The goal of evolving the variometer into a best-in-class product remains unchanged.

The original ambition of providing a high-quality variometer sensor that turns any club glider with an outdated variometer into a fun-to-fly glider remains unchanged. In addition, new capabilities are being introduced to address several long-standing limitations of conventional variometer designs. The objective is to reduce the pilot's cognitive workload by automating routine tasks, allowing more attention to be focused on safe and efficient cross-country flying.
New features are/will be:

* Auto calibration for TEK and sensor synchronisation/fusion.
  - resulting in uncompromising TE variometer accuracy with a single indicator
  - no requirement for a TE probe any more
  - overcoming the tube latency introduced hurdles from attached probes
* Extended acoustics 
  - morphing a traditional electronic variometer tone to a fully sonified variometer display.
  - assisting flap setting through sounds
  - reintroduces Peter Zander's thermal-assistance audio cues
  - add gust audio overlays to improve interpretation of variometer indications during high-speed cruise
  - route numerous warnings through the acoustic channel
* User interaction
  - refined for intuitive fingertip operation
  - convert numerical values into intuitive pilot guidance (for example, McCready: Slow / Medium / Best Glide)
* Instant wind
  - help the pilot remain aligned with thermal streets and cloud streets
